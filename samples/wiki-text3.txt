In [[microeconomics]] and [[management]], '''vertical integration''' is an arrangement in which the [[supply chain]] of a company is owned by that company. Usually each member of the supply chain produces a different [[product (business)|product]] or (market-specific) service, and the products combine to satisfy a common need. It is contrasted with [[horizontal integration]], wherein a company produces several items which are related to one another. Vertical integration has also described [[management style]]s that bring large portions of the supply chain not only under a common ownership, but also into one [[corporation]] (as in the 1920s when the [[Ford River Rouge Complex]] began making much of its own steel rather than buying it from suppliers).

Vertical integration and expansion is desired because it secures the supplies needed by the firm to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product. Vertical integration and expansion can become undesirable when its actions become anti-competitive and impede free competition in an open marketplace. Vertical integration is one method of avoiding the [[hold-up problem]]. A monopoly produced through vertical integration is called a "vertical monopoly".

==Vertical expansion==
Vertical integration is often closely associated to vertical expansion which, in [[economics]], is the growth of a business enterprise through the [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]] of companies that produce the intermediate goods needed by the business or help market and distribute its product. Such expansion is desired because it secures the supplies needed by the [[business|firm]] to produce its product and the market needed to sell the product. Such expansion can become undesirable when its actions become [[anti-competitive]] and impede free competition in an open marketplace.

The result is a more efficient business with lower costs and more profits. On the undesirable side, when vertical expansion leads toward [[monopoly|monopolistic]] control of a product or service then regulative action may be required to rectify anti-competitive behavior. Related to vertical expansion is [[lateral expansion]], which is the growth of a business enterprise through the acquisition of similar firms, in the hope of achieving [[economies of scale]].

Vertical expansion is also known as a vertical acquisition. Vertical expansion or acquisitions can also be used to increase scales and to gain market power. The acquisition of [[DirecTV]] by [[News Corporation]] is an example of forward vertical expansion or acquisition. DirecTV is a [[satellite TV]] company through which News Corporation can distribute more of its media content: news, movies and television shows. The acquisition of [[NBC]] by [[Comcast]] is an example of backward vertical integration. For example, in the United States, protecting the public from communications monopolies that can be built in this way is one of the missions of the [[Federal Communications Commission]].

==Three types of vertical integration==
[[File:Integration in English.svg|400px|thumb|right|A diagram illustrating vertical integration and contrasting it with horizontal integration{{Elucidate|date=August 2014}}{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}]]  Contrary to [[horizontal integration]], which is a consolidation of many firms that handle the same part of the production process, vertical integration is typified by one firm engaged in different parts of production (e.g., growing raw materials, manufacturing, transporting, marketing, and/or [[retailing]]).  Vertical integration is the degree to which a firm owns its upstream suppliers and its downstream buyers.

There are three varieties of vertical integration: backward (upstream) vertical integration, forward (downstream) vertical integration, and balanced (both upstream and downstream) vertical integration.
*A company exhibits '''backward vertical integration''' when it controls [[subsidiaries]] that produce some of the inputs used in the production of its products. For example, an automobile company may own a [[tire]] company, a [[glass]] company, and a metal company. Control of these three subsidiaries is intended to create a stable supply of inputs and ensure a consistent quality in their final product. It was the main business approach of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and other car companies in the 1920s, who sought to minimize costs by integrating the production of cars and car parts, as exemplified in the [[Ford River Rouge Complex]].
*A company tends toward '''forward vertical integration''' when it controls distribution centers and retailers where its products are sold. An example is a brewing company that owns and controls a number of bars or pubs.

[[Disintermediation]] is a form of vertical integration when purchasing departments take over the former role of wholesalers to source products.<ref name="maninn">{{cite book |title=Management Innovation: Essays in the Spirit of Alfred D.

==Problems and benefits==

There are internal and external society-wide gains and losses stemming from vertical integration, which vary according to the state of technology in the industries involved, roughly corresponding to the stages of the industry lifecycle.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Static technology represents the simplest case, where the gains and losses have been studied extensively.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}
A vertically integrated company usually fails when transactions within the market are too risky or the contracts to support these risks are too costly to administer, such as frequent transactions and a small number of buyers and sellers.

===Internal gains===
*Lower [[transaction costs]]
*Synchronization of [[supply and demand]] along the chain of products
*Lower uncertainty and higher investment
*Ability to [[Monopoly|monopolize]] market throughout the chain by [[market foreclosure]]
*Strategic independence (especially if important inputs are rare or highly volatile in price, such as [[rare-earth metals]]).

===Internal losses===

*Higher monetary and organizational costs of switching to other suppliers/buyers
*Weaker motivation for good performance at the start of the supply chain since sales are guaranteed and poor quality may be blended into other inputs at later manufacturing stages

===Benefits to society===
*Better opportunities for investment growth through reduced uncertainty
*Local companies are often better positioned against foreign competition

===Losses to society===
*[[Monopolization]] of markets
*Rigid [[organizational structure]]
*Manipulation of prices
*Loss of tax revenue

==Selected examples==
===Birdseye===
During a hunting trip, an American explorer and scientist, [[Clarence Birdseye]], discovered the beneficial effects of [[quick freezing]]. For example, fish caught a few days previously that were kept in ice remained in perfect condition.

In 1924, Clarence Birdseye patented the "Birdseye Plate Froster" and set up the General Seafood Corporation. In 1929, Birdseye's company and the patent were bought by Postum Company and the Goldman-Sachs trading Corporation. It later came to be known as [[General Foods]]. They kept the same Birdseye name, but it was split into two words (Birds eye) for use as a trademark. Birdseye was paid $20 million for the patents and $2 million for the assets.

Birdseye was one of the pioneers in the [[frozen food]] industry. Birdseye Company  used vertical integration to manage their business. Because during these times, there was not a well-developed infrastructure to produce and sell, Birdseye developed its own system by using vertical integration. As many members of the supply chain, such as farmers and small food retailers, couldn't afford high costs to buy equipment, Birdseye provided them with equipment.

But until now, Birdseye has faded slowly because they have fixed costs associated with vertical integration, such as property, plants, and equipment that cannot be reduced significantly when production needs decrease. The Birdseye company used vertical integration to create a larger organization structure with more levels of command that produced a slower informational processing rate, with the side effect of making the company so slow, that it couldn't react quickly and didn't take advantages of the growth of supermarkets, until ten years after the competition. The already-developed infrastructure did not allow Birdseye to quickly react to market changes.

===Alibaba===
In order to increase profits and gain more market share, [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]], a Chinese-based company, has implemented vertical integration deepening its company holdings to more than the e-commerce platform. Alibaba has built its leadership in the market by gradually acquiring complementary companies in a variety of industries including delivery and payments.

===Steel and oil===
One of the earliest, largest and most famous examples of vertical integration was the [[Carnegie Steel]] company. The company controlled not only the mills where the [[steel]] was made, but also the mines where the [[iron ore]] was extracted, the coal mines that supplied the [[coal]], the ships that transported the iron ore and the railroads that transported the coal to the factory, the [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens where the coal was cooked, etc. The company focused heavily on developing talent internally from the bottom up, rather than importing it from other companies.<ref>Folsom, Burton ''The Myth of the Robber Barons'' 5th edition. 2007. pg. 65. {{ISBN|978-0963020314}}. "only we can develop ''ability'' and hold it in our service. Every year should be marked by the promotion of one or more of our young men."</ref>{{full citation needed|date=April 2015}} Later, Carnegie established [[Carnegie Institute of Technology|an institute]] of higher learning to teach the steel processes to the next generation.

[[Petroleum industry|Oil companies]], both multinational (such as [[ExxonMobil]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[ConocoPhillips]] or [[BP]]) and national (e.g., [[Petronas]]) often adopt a vertically integrated structure, meaning that they are active along the entire supply chain from [[Hydrocarbon exploration|locating deposits]], drilling and extracting [[crude oil]], transporting it around the world, [[Oil refinery|refining]] it into petroleum products such as [[gasoline|petrol/gasoline]], to distributing the fuel to company-owned retail stations, for sale to consumers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Telecommunications and computing===
Telephone companies in most of the 20th century, especially the largest (the [[Bell System]]) were integrated, making their own [[telephone]]s, [[telephone cable]]s, [[telephone exchange]] equipment and other supplies.<ref>http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3641&context=clr</ref>

===Entertainment===
From the early 1920s through the early 1950s, the American [[motion picture]] had evolved into an industry controlled by a few companies, a condition known as a "mature [[oligopoly]]", as it was led by eight [[major film studio]]s, the most powerful of which were the "Big Five" studios: [[MGM]], [[Warner Brothers]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Paramount Pictures]], and [[RKO]].<ref name="Alberti2014">{{cite book|author=John Alberti|title=Screen Ages: A Survey of American Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J06cBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA108|date=27 November 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-65028-7|pages=108–}}</ref> These studios were fully integrated, not only producing and distributing films, but also operating their own [[movie theater]]s; the "Little Three", [[Universal Studios]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[United Artists]], produced and distributed feature films but did not own theaters.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The issue of vertical integration (also known as common ownership) has been the main focus of policy makers because of the possibility of anti-competitive behaviors affiliated with market influence. For example, in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'', the Supreme Court ordered the five vertically integrated studios to sell off their theater chains and all trade practices were prohibited (United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 1948).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Oba | first1 = Goro | last2 = Chan-Olmstead | first2 = Sylvia | year = 2006 | title = Self-Dealing or Market Transaction?: An Exploratory Study of Vertical Integration in the U.S. Television Syndication Market | url = | journal = Journal of Media Economics | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 99–118 | doi=10.1207/s15327736me1902_2}}</ref> The prevalence of vertical integration wholly predetermined the relationships between both studios and networks{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} and modified criteria in financing. Networks began arranging content initiated by commonly owned studios and stipulated a portion of the syndication revenues in order for a show to gain a spot on the schedule if it was produced by a studio without common ownership.<ref>[[Amanda D. Lotz|Lotz, Amanda D.]] (2007) "The Television Will Be Revolutionized". New York, NY: New York University Press. p.87</ref> In response, the studios fundamentally changed the way they made movies and did business. Lacking the financial resources and contract talent they once controlled, the studios now relied on independent producers supplying some portion of the budget in exchange for distribution rights.<ref>{{cite book|author1=McDonald, P.  |author2=Wasko, J. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|location=Australia|isbn=9781405133876|pages=14–17}}</ref>

Certain [[media conglomerates]] may, in a similar manner, own television broadcasters (either over-the-air or on cable), production companies that produce content for their networks, and also own the services that distribute their content to viewers (such as television and internet service providers). [[AT&T]], [[Bell Canada]], [[Comcast]], [[Sky plc]], and [[Rogers Communications]] are vertically integrated in such a manner{{emdash}}operating media subsidiaries (such as [[WarnerMedia]], [[Bell Media]], [[NBCUniversal]], and [[Rogers Media]]), and provide "[[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]]" services of television, internet, and phone service in some markets (such as [[Bell TV]]/[[Bell Internet]], [[Rogers Cable]], [[Xfinity]], and Sky's satellite TV and internet services). Additionally, Bell and Rogers own wireless providers, [[Bell Mobility]] and [[Rogers Wireless]], while Comcast is partnered with [[Verizon Wireless]] for an Xfinity-branded [[mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]]. Similarly, [[Sony]] has media holdings through its [[Sony Pictures]] division, including film and television content, as well as television channels, but is also a manufacturer of [[consumer electronic]]s that can be used to consume content from itself and others, including televisions, phones, and [[PlayStation]] video game consoles. AT&T is the first ever vertical integration were a mobile phone company and a film studio company are under same umbrella.

===Agriculture===
{{further information | Meat industry}}
Vertical integration through production and marketing contracts have also become the dominant model for [[livestock]] production. Currently, 90% of poultry, 69% of hogs, and 29% of cattle are contractually produced through vertical integration.<ref name="livestock">Paul Stokstad, Enforcing Environmental Law in an Unequal Market: The Case of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, 15 Mo. Envtl. L. & Pol’y Rev. 229, 234-36 (Spring 2008)</ref> The USDA supports vertical integration because it has increased food productivity. However, "... contractors receive a large share of farm receipts, formerly assumed to go to the operator's family".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/aer-agricultural-economic-report/aer747.aspx#.UpaBmsRONqU |title=USDA ERS - Farmers' Use of Marketing and Production Contracts |publisher=Ers.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}</ref>

Under production contracts, growers raise animals owned by integrators. Farm contracts contain detailed conditions for growers, who are paid based on how efficiently they use feed, provided by the integrator, to raise the animals. The contract dictates how to construct the facilities, how to feed, house, and medicate the animals, and how to handle manure and dispose of carcasses. Generally, the contract also shields the integrator from liability.<ref name="livestock" /> [[Jim Hightower]], in his book, ''Eat Your Heart Out'',<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Eat_Your_Heart_Out.html?id=qaxIAAAAYAAJ |title=Eat Your Heart Out: Food Profiteering in America - Jim Hightower - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2015-04-24}}</ref> discusses this liability role enacted by large food companies. He finds that in many cases of agricultural vertical integration, the integrator ([[food company]]) denies the farmer the right of entrepreneurship. This means that the farmer can only sell ''under'' and ''to'' the integrator. These restrictions on specified growth, [[Jim Hightower|Hightower]] argues, strips the selling and producing power of the farmer. The producer is ultimately limited by the established standards of the integrator. Yet, at the same time, the integrator still keeps the responsibility connected to the farmer. [[Jim Hightower|Hightower]] sees this as ownership without reliability.<ref>Hightower, Jim. ''Eat Your Heart Out'', 1975, Crown Publishing. pg 162-168, {{ISBN|978-0517524541}}</ref>

Under marketing contracts, growers agree in advance to sell their animals to integrators under an agreed price system. Generally, these contracts shield the integrator from liability for the grower’s actions and the only negotiable item is a price.<ref name="livestock" />

===Automotive industry===
In the United States new automobiles can not be sold at dealerships owned by the same company that produced them but are protected by state franchise laws.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = Surowiecki | first = James | date = September 4, 2006 | title = Dealer’s Choice | url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/04/dealers-choice-2 | magazine = The New Yorker | access-date = October 1, 2016}}</ref>

===Eyewear===
[[Luxottica]] owns 80% of the market share of companies that produce corrective and protective [[eyewear]] as well as owning many retailers, optical departments at [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Sears]], and key eye insurance groups, such as [[EyeMed]].<ref name="SIXTYMINUTES2012">{{cite news|title=Sticker shock: Why are glasses so expensive?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57527151/sticker-shock-why-are-glasses-so-expensive/|newspaper=[[60 Minutes]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=October 7, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | last = Goodman | first = Andrew | date = July 16, 2014 | title = There's More to Ray-Ban and Oakley Than Meets the Eye | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/agoodman/2014/07/16/theres-more-to-ray-ban-and-oakley-than-meets-the-eye/ | magazine = Forbes | access-date = October 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | last = Swanson | first = Ana | date = September 10, 2014 | title = Meet the Four-Eyed, Eight-Tentacled Monopoly That is Making Your Glasses So Expensive | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/anaswanson/2014/09/10/meet-the-four-eyed-eight-tentacled-monopoly-that-is-making-your-glasses-so-expensive/#2adff9764dc8 | magazine = Forbes | access-date = October 1, 2016}}</ref>
